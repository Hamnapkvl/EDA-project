# ✈️ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction data to identify
the key factors affecting customer experience and operational
performance.

The analysis combines: - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Statistical
Hypothesis Testing (T-Test, Chi-Square, ANOVA) - Correlation Analysis -
Feature Engineering

## 📊 Key Insights

### 🎯 1. Service Quality Drives Satisfaction

Seat comfort, cleanliness, food, and inflight entertainment strongly
influence passenger satisfaction.\
Service features are highly correlated (0.58--0.70), indicating
passengers evaluate experience holistically.

### ⏱️ 2. Delays Reduce Satisfaction

T-Test shows a significant difference in departure delays between
satisfied and dissatisfied passengers (p \< 0.05).\
Higher delays → Higher dissatisfaction.

### 🏷️ 3. Travel Class Matters

Chi-Square test confirms a significant relationship between class and
satisfaction.\
Business class passengers show higher satisfaction rates than Eco and
Eco Plus.

### 👥 4. Age Group Differences

ANOVA indicates satisfaction varies across age groups.\
Middle-aged passengers show relatively higher satisfaction compared to
seniors.
